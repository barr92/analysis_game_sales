## Integrated Project: Game Sales Analysis

Welcome to the Integrated Project repository, where we analyze game sales data for Ice, a prominent online video game store catering to global markets. This project aims to uncover patterns that determine a game's success, allowing us to identify potential blockbusters and optimize advertising campaigns effectively.

### Project Overview

Our task is to analyze a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2016, simulating a real-life scenario where we plan a marketing campaign for 2017. By leveraging user and expert reviews, genre categorizations, platform information (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation), and historical sales data, we seek to identify key factors that contribute to a game's success.

### Repository Structure

1. **Data**: The `datasets/games.csv` file contains the dataset used for analysis. Please download it to proceed with the project.

2. **Instructions**: The project instructions are outlined in the Jupyter Notebook. It provides step-by-step guidance on how to approach the analysis and fulfill the project requirements.

3. **Code**: The code cells in the Jupyter Notebook include Python implementations for data preparation, analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization. The code is thoroughly documented to ensure clarity and understanding.

4. **Results**: The Jupyter Notebook includes markdown cells for text explanations, findings, and conclusions derived from the data analysis. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

### Project Evaluation

Our project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Problem Identification**: Clearly articulate the challenges and goals of the analysis.
- **Data Preparation**: Handle data cleaning, type conversion, and missing value treatment effectively.
- **Analysis and Visualization**: Construct insightful visualizations, analyze trends, and identify key patterns.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate and test hypotheses using appropriate statistical methods.
- **Results Interpretation**: Provide comprehensive explanations of findings, highlighting actionable insights.
- **Code Organization**: Maintain a well-structured and readable codebase.
- **Documentation**: Include relevant comments, markdown cells, and a comprehensive general conclusion.
