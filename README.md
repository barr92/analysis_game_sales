## Game Sales Analysis

Welcome to the Integrated Project repository, where we analyze game sales data for Ice, a prominent online video game store catering to global markets. This project aims to uncover patterns that determine a game's success, allowing us to identify potential blockbusters and optimize advertising campaigns effectively.

### Project Overview

The video game store Ice sells video games across the world, they collect date on each game such as the total sales per region and user reviews. Our aim here is to identify pattens that determine whether a game has succeeded after it's release and whether there has been enough sales. The analysis will help Ice games to modify their marketing and sales tactics around games consoles as well as helping the procurement teams decide which games and consoles bring in the most sales.

Throughout the analysis we will test the following hypothesis:

Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.

### Objective
The objective of this data analysis project is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of video games and their sales performance. By analyzing the available data, we aim to answer crucial questions such as:

- What characteristics of a game make it more likely to succeed?
- Which platforms are leading in sales and which ones are declining?
- How do user and professional reviews impact sales?
- Which genres are the most profitable?

Through our analysis, we will explore various aspects of the data, including historical game sales, user and expert reviews, genres, platforms, and ratings. By uncovering key insights, we will enable Ice to make data-driven decisions, such as identifying potential big winners, planning targeted advertising campaigns, and optimizing their game and console procurement strategies.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to empower Ice with actionable insights that will enhance their understanding of the video game market and enable them to make informed decisions to maximize their sales and profitability. By leveraging the power of data analysis, we will help Ice stay ahead in the dynamic and competitive video game industry.
