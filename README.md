## Integrated Project: Game Sales Analysis

Welcome to the Integrated Project repository, where we analyze game sales data for Ice, a prominent online video game store catering to global markets. This project aims to uncover patterns that determine a game's success, allowing us to identify potential blockbusters and optimize advertising campaigns effectively.

### Project Overview

Our task is to analyze a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2016, simulating a real-life scenario where we plan a marketing campaign for 2017. By leveraging user and expert reviews, genre categorizations, platform information (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation), and historical sales data, we seek to identify key factors that contribute to a game's success.

### Repository Structure

1. **Data**: The `datasets/games.csv` file contains the dataset used for analysis. Please download it to proceed with the project.

2. **Code**: The code cells in the Jupyter Notebook include Python implementations for data preparation, analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization. The code is thoroughly documented to ensure clarity and understanding.

3. **Results**: The Jupyter Notebook includes markdown cells for text explanations, findings, and conclusions derived from the data analysis. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

### Project Evaluation

Our project was evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Problem Identification**: Clearly articulate the challenges and goals of the analysis.
